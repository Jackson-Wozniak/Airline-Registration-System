We welcome any contributions! This repo is a great platform for learning & exploring technologies, and could be used for those who enjoy aviation tracking as well.

If you have ideas for contributions you would like to create, or bug fixes of any kind, create an issue outlining what you are interested in
doing. This repo is primarily intented to be used for learning new technologies, and there are currently no plans to deploy this to the public. 
I built this mostly as a hobby project & to learn microservices, and it does not serve any real-world commercial purpose.
With that said, if you would like to use this as a platform for learning, or you are otherwise interested in this repo, feel free to start contributing!
